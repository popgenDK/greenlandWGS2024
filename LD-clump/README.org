#+title: Peak finding via LD-based clumping

To account for population structure in calculating LD, we used the adjusted LD
method https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.02.592187v1 for LD-based
clumping, which is implemented in https://github.com/Zilong-Li/PCAone. We used
PCAone v0.4.4 in our analyses while the most recent version is v0.4.7. More
specifically, we run PCAone with =k=5= first to get the residuals matrix and then
run LD clumping algorithms given different association inputs.

The example pipeline is detailed in [[file:z-ld-clump.sh]], and can be run:

#+begin_src shell
bash z-ld-clump.sh rec  ## for association with reccesive model
bash z-ld-clump.sh add  ## for association with additive model
#+end_src
