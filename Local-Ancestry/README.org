The imputed and phased Greenlandic data were used in the analyses. Given the
haplotype based admixture analyses, we identified 99 unadmixed Greenlandic
Inuit. There, we infered the local ancestry for the admixed individuals using
RFmix v2 with unadmixed Greenlandic Inuit (N=99) and unrelated Europeans (N=313,
CEU, IBS, TSI) from the 1KG project as reference populations. The pipeline can
be found in the [[file:z-rfmix.sh]] script.
